# Awesome Swift Language Examples

A collaborative list of Swift language concept examples. It can be tutorials, write ups, gists and more. Each section will be based on the [Swift Language Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/). 

What makes an **Awesome Swift Language Example**?

An example should include an explanation on the concepts so others can easily understand it.

Good examples can be in this form:
 
- Has comments explaning the code if you are only submiting a link to a gist or playground
- Has a README explaning what was implemented if if's a repository
- A write up explaning the concept, how they have understood it and show different ways of using it. 
- A video tutorial/explainer explaining the concept and showing ways to use it.

If you found something online that **has helped you understand the concept** then that can be an Awesome Swift Language Example!

Note: You can submit your own example if you feel it can help others. If you want to start writing and is looking for a platform, you can use [Dubdub Space](https://dubdub.space) as your platform if you don't have one yet.

Feel free to add your examples here. :)
